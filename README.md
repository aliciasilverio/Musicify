# Videoify

##### Videoify is a web application that allows users to search for and add their favorite YouTube videos to their favorites list. It is a full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) app, meaning that users can create, view, edit, and delete their favorite videos.

##### To use Videoify, users simply need to enter the name of the artist or song they are searching for in the search bar. The app will then use the YouTube API to pull in a list of related videos and display them on the screen. From here, users can click on any video they like and add it to their favorites list.

##### Once a video has been added to the favorites list, users can view their list at any time by clicking on the "favorites" tab. From here, they can choose to delete any videos they no longer wish to keep on their list, or edit the information associated with a particular video.

##### Overall, Videoify is a convenient and user-friendly way for music lovers to keep track of their favorite YouTube videos and easily access them whenever they want.
